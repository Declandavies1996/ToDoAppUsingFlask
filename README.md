### What I Have Learned

Building this Flask to-do app has provided valuable insights into web development, Python programming, and user interface design. Key takeaways include:

1. **Web Development Basics:** Learned how to create a basic web application using Flask, including routing, handling requests, and rendering templates.

2. **Frontend and Styling:** Gained experience in using Bootstrap to enhance the user interface and make the app responsive across different devices.

3. **User Interactions:** Implemented user interactions such as adding, completing, and deleting tasks, enhancing my understanding of form handling and dynamic content.

4. **Server-Client Interaction:** Learned how the server and client (browser) communicate through HTTP requests and responses.

5. **Version Control:** Practiced using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration on software projects.

6. **Error Handling:** Dealt with potential errors, such as module imports and route handling, enhancing my problem-solving skills.

7. **Documentation:** Created a `README.md` file to provide clear instructions for installing, using, and understanding the app.

Overall, this project has solidified my understanding of web development concepts and provided hands-on experience in creating a functional web application using Flask and Bootstrap.
